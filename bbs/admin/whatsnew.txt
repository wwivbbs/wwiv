                 Copyright 1999-2016 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

What's New in WWIV 5.2 (2016)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added "WWIVUTIL FILES" subcommand to list files, file areas and also
  delete a file entry from the listing.
* Fixed "WWIVUTIL FIX" with file entries. It actually works again.
* Login prompt looks a little snazzier, uses the colorized input prompt.
* config.dat now includes version info on what wrote to it for better
  versioning of upgrades.  The only change is now if you go back to 4.3
  you will need to run init to reset your newuser password (if you have
  one, or to clear it on downgrade since the newuserpw field and version
  info in config.dat live in the same first 21 characters in the file.)
* CONFUG.USR is no longer needed, INIT in 5.2.2129+ will move the data into
  user.lst and delete the file.
* Removed command line option -O, since -X{T,S} implies -O
* Removed Control-F1 to shutdown the BBS, it's not needed anymore on
  non-single user operating systems.
* Removed TAB {Instance Editor, didn't really edit, just allowed you to see
  status or shutdown an instance} command from WFC. Not really needed anymore.
* BBS now uses the network support code from the SDK module (like net51).
* nodemgr is deleted.  wwivd is the new preferred *nix daemon for spawning
  instances.
* bbs -XU is no longer supported.  valid connection types are local, ssh and
  telnet on all platforms.
* bbs -I# is no longer supported. It's been a duplicate of -N forever, please
  use -N## to specify the node number. (It also hasn't worked for quite some
  time)
* installation now includes sample scripts for systemd.
* wwivserver (windows), can now run networkb on demand for receiving connections
  automatically. Make sure that you configure it on the binkp page. This won't
  callout but will receive network binkp requests.
* / callout menu displays host:port if it's a binkp connection.
* callout.net flag /## now means ## minutes not ## hours
* wwivutil net dump_xxx commands are now just called wwivutil net xxx
  for example dump_callout -> callout
* networkb now supports CRC verification when sending files. To disable it
  set crc=N in the newly created net.ini
* net.ini can now handle defaults on a per-network basis or
  per-network-node basis (when calling out) using tags of 
  [networkb-network_name] and [networkb-network_name-sendto_node].
  The only settings are crc=[Y|N] and skip_net=[Y|N].
* The short lived networkb.ini is renamed to net.ini (yes, this is the same
  as the WINS one, but WINS will go away over time).
* networkb will loop on receive, no need to run binkp.cmd, but
  since wwivserver can answer binkp for you, no need to run networkb
  manually to receive traffic.
* wwivutil messages now has a pack comand to pack a message area.
* Network names "Filenet" and "internet" no longer have special meaning,
  within the BBS, please ensure those networks are of type "internet" for
  WWIV to understand those are internet network types. (don't rename them
  since WINS may care about the name).

What's New in WWIV 5.1 (2016)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* removed "debug_level" and Debug menu command. use VLOG(2) now.
* "extra color" was only used in transfer section w/o listplus 
  (which means it's not ever used). removed the checks for it.  This
  will come back in the future somewhere else to be useful.
* Added IP blacklisting/whitelisting and auto blocking. The settings
  are on the blacklist page in wwivserver.exe. By default 3 connection
  attempts in 120 seconds will get an IP blacklisted.
* The wwiv server also pretends to be a FTN mailer for fun.
* Removed F6 (toggle sysop alert), to page you after a session ends, since
  this isn't needed post-DOS anymore.
* Added wwiv-update.exe (contributed to WWIV by TRI0N from 
  https://github.com/TRI0N/Windows-WWIV-Update/) into nightly builds.  
  wwiv-update.exe is the name of the new binary.
* SSH support. Use -XS as the commandline argumetn vs. -XT for telnet.
* networkb will use CRAM-MD5 for authentication by default if both
  systems support it.
* The wwiv.ini setting TERMINAL_CMD will be used to launch a terminal
  program from the WFC using the 'T' command (again).
* WWIV5TelnetServer has a log viewer built in you may use to see the
  state of the various WWIV and network log files.
* net.log is now written in normal order for log files with the newest
  entry at the bottom and never truncated to behave like the rest of 
  the log files in WWIV.
* The two laston lists in WWIV have been merged into one.  Now last few
  callers will always display the last few callers regardless of the 
  day they called.
* Added -XU command line type for UNIX communication type. On UNIX we
  temporarily use that type by default for now.
* UNIX Local IO is now curses based. Win32 can optionally use curses
  for local IO by defining WWIV_WIN32_CURSES_IO.
* Removed "-w" argument to BBS since there is now just 1 WFC (again).
* Removed the --network=[net name] option from networkb.exe, now please
  use --network_number=N (where N is like you would use with network1 .N)
* Created alpha-quality network{1,2,3} replacements.  Please feel free to
  try them out. They will eventually become net51 and replace the DOS based
  net38.
* Renamed WWIV5TelnetServer to WWIVServer, since it also does SSH too.
* Numeric subtypes are no longer used.  Here's the diff of the change
  in case you run an older WWIV and want to mod it to behave the same
  way (using a string version for numeric types).  Otherwise just don't
  use numeric named subs anymore.

*   

What's New in WWIV 5.1 (2015)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Message titles are now limited to 72 characters (same as FidoNet message)
  limits.  In reality they would get truncated around this length anyway and
  in most places WWIV still forces a max of 60 characters.
* Internal application-level caching for posts have been removed. It didn't help
  access times anymore and added lots of unneeded complexity.
* Started new utility WWIVUTIL which will eventually handle maintenance
  tasks for the bbs.
* Updated menus/textfiles to reflect 5.1 and also remove commands that have
  been removed years ago.
* LOCAL_SYSOP has been removed from wwiv.ini, it's always true now.
* Callback support has been removed the rest of the way.
* Threaded messages support has been removed (it didn't work anyway).
* NETUTIL has been merged into WWIVUTIL.  Going forward, WWIVUTIL will be
  the main external command line tool for WWIV on all platforms.
* Removed menu commands DownloadPosts and DownloadFileList and the 
  Download Zipped Text menu item from //QWK (all did the same thing).
* Removed ability to run WWIVMAIL.EXE from the //QWK menu. If anyone
  wants this, then can add their own //QWK menu now that we have a
  menu editor since 4.3. This removed USE_WWIVMAIL and USE_INTERNAL_QWK
  from wwiv.ini.
* removed SLASH_SZ from wwiv.ini. It wasn't enabled by default anyway.
* Removed ReadMessages menu item. It wasn't classic WWIV

What's New in 2015 (WWIV 5.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* networkb - BINKP transport for WWIV networking is now part of the WWIV builds.
* netutil - Network packet and config file utility now included
* network - shim to proxy between network0, networkp (PPP project) and networkb
  is now part of the product.
* A SSM will be sent to the sysop when a new user joins the bbs.
* WWIV moved from wwiv.sf.net to wwivbbs.org
* Source code moved from sourceforge.net to GitHub.
* Upgraded compilers from MSVC 2013 to 2015 Community.
* Upgraded .NET from 4.0 to 4.6
* Fixed hangs with guest user accounts when they drop connection
* Made all QWK filenames lowercase
* zip/unzip now bundled with WWIV on Windows
* linux builds now just include linux files, ditto for windows

What's New in 2014 (WWIV 5.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Many more things work.
* Init is open sourced
* Full self-bootstrapping support. No longer need 4.30 installed first.
* Added new parameter for chains/commands %H = Telnet Socket Handle
* Added wwiv.ini setting NO_NEWUSER_FEEDBACK. If set to Y no newuser messages
  will be sent at all.
* Added wwiv.ini setings to control temp/batch directories. This is no longer
  configured in init.  For TEMP_DIRECTORY/BATCH_DIRECTORY the %n is replaced
  by the node number of the instance. Also paths are relative to the bbs home
  directory (where config.dat lives).  NUM_INSTANCES defines how many intances
  you want to spawn.  Also node that directories are created on demand by the
  bbs on startup and config.ovr will be created by legacy tools when you run
  init.  
  Here are the default values:
    TEMP_DIRECTORY = temp%n
    BATCH_DIRECTORY = batch%n
    NUM_INSTANCES = 4
* INIT will create default archiver configuration for infozip's unzip/zip. If
  you want to try it just delete archiver.dat (back it up first) and rerun
  INIT to create the new defaults.
* Internal QWK support has been added and only works with ZIP archives for now.
  If you use this, please add the QWK.ANS and QWK.MSG files from the release
  archive into your GFILES directory.
* Added new wwiv.ini setting to enable/disable internal QWK and wwivmail from
  the //QWK menu.  These currently both default to 'Y' (the wwivmail one will
  shortly default to 'N', so if you use it please add this to your INI)
  Here are the ini keys and default values:
    USE_WWIVMAIL = Y
    USE_INTERNAL_QWK = Y
* New files will optionally be displayed at login (right after "login" file):
  sl### : where ### is the current user SL.
  dsl### : where ### is the current user DSL.
  arX : Where X is one of the AR for the user.
  darX : Where X is one of the DAR for the user.
* Added support for QBBS style external editors. Just set the editor type to
  QuickBBS instead of WWIV.
* SPAWNOPT[FSED] is now unused and no longer supported.  Spawn options are now
  set on a per-editor bases in INIT (similiar to how chains work).
* Fix now defaults to only fixing critical files.  To enable other "fixes" 
  (which I recommend using at your own risk after you backed up DATA/" use
  the command line flags to enable each of these.  See fix -? for help.
* EXEC_WAITFORIDLETIME and EXEC_USECWAITFORIDLE are no longer used, 
  EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME  should be used to set how long to wait for exec'ed
  processes to become runnable. It defaults to 500ms.

What's New in 5.0 Beta-2 (2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Archver commands now work.
* F1 User Editor Improvements
* PuTTY now works with auto-detect line mode
* WFC now clears the screen in places it forgot to.
* Fixed Pending Network display glitches
* Changed Message Scan Prompt to 1 line from 2.
* Added Litebar calls in Your Info and Voting Booth for 
  a more common look and feel.

What's New in 5.0 Beta-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* File compatable with 4.30/4.31
* 32-bit Win32 version.
* Compiles and Runs on Linux.
* Included GUI Telnet Server.
* Internal ZModem
* DOOR32.SYS support.
* Uses the SyncFoss code from Synchronet (thanks to Rob Swindell for helping
  get this to work)  "Emulate Win32 FOSSIL" enables this.
* Added commandline option -k (pacK message areas) to wwiv50.  This 
  will pack all message areas unless you specify the number of the
  areas to pack on the commandline. i.e. "wwiv50 -k 1 5 10" would
  pack areas 1, 5 and 10. (Build46)
* If you add "NEW_SCAN_AT_LOGIN=Y" to WWIV.INI, then when a user logs 
  in they will be asked to scan all message areas for new messages. (Build46)
* The display while packing message bases is now a bit nicer looking.
* Changed filename global.txt to global-<node number>.txt (Build43)
* Added control-U for who's online hotkey. (Build40)
* Fixed laston edge case where the header didn't match the data when
  EXTENDED_USERINFO = N but SHOW_CITY_ST = Y. (Build40)
* FOSSIL can now be specified in WWIV.INI as a valid flag for spawn 
  options (Build37)
* Added 2 new pipe codes:
  * |#<wwiv color code 0-9> as an alternative to the "heart" codes
  * |@<macro character> as an alternative to ^O^O<macro char>
  * Existing pipe codes are: |B<background char>, and |<2 digit code>
    for foreground colors. (Build36) 
* Added parameter "%E" to stuff_in which can be used in doors as the path 
  to the DOOR32.SYS file (You can put this in chainedit or init) (Build35)
* Detects WinXP (Build34)
* '/A', '/H', '/?' Added to internal message editor (Build33)
* New WWIV.INI Parameters
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  EXEC_LOGSYNCFOSS     = [ 1 | 0 ] - If non-zero then wwivsync.log will 
                         be generated.  The default setting is 1 and this
                         is currently ignored.
  EXEC_USECWAITFORIDLE = [ 1 | 0 ] - Under WindowsNT/2K/XP when launching
                         the child process WWIV uses WaitForInputIdle to wait
                         for the child process to process all normal input 
                         before starting the Fossil handling code.  Setting
                         this to 0 will disable that (acting like Win9x where
                         we just wait for a bit (See EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME).  The
                         default value of this is 1.
  EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME   = (time to wait in milliseconds, this parameter is
                         only used on Win9X unless EXEC_USEWAITFORIDLE is
                         set to 0. The default value is 500 (1/2 second)
  EXEC_WAITFORIDLETIME = (time to wait in milliseconds, only used on 
                         Windows NT/2K/XP unless EXEC_USEWAITFORIDLE=0).  The
                         default value for this is 2000 (2 seconds)
