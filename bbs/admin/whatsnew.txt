                           WWIV 5.1 What's New List
                 Copyright 1999-2016 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

What's New in WWIV 5.1 (2016)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Removed F6 (toggle sysop alert), to page you after a session ends, since
  this isn't needed post-DOS anymore.
* Added wwiv-update.exe (contributed to WWIV by TRI0N from 
  https://github.com/TRI0N/Windows-WWIV-Update/) into nightly builds.  
  wwiv-update.exe is the name of the new binary.
* SSH support. Use -XS as the commandline argumetn vs. -XT for telnet.

What's New in WWIV 5.1 (2015)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Message titles are now limited to 72 characters (same as FidoNet message)
  limits.  In reality they would get truncated around this length anyway and
  in most places WWIV still forces a max of 60 characters.
* Internal application-level caching for posts have been removed. It didn't help
  access times anymore and added lots of unneeded complexity.
* Started new utility WWIVUTIL which will eventually handle maintenance
  tasks for the bbs.
* Updated menus/textfiles to reflect 5.1 and also remove commands that have
  been removed years ago.
* LOCAL_SYSOP has been removed from wwiv.ini, it's always true now.
* Callback support has been removed the rest of the way.
* Threaded messages support has been removed (it didn't work anyway).
* NETUTIL has been merged into WWIVUTIL.  Going forward, WWIVUTIL will be
  the main external command line tool for WWIV on all platforms.
* Removed menu commands DownloadPosts and DownloadFileList and the 
  Download Zipped Text menu item from //QWK (all did the same thing).
* Removed ability to run WWIVMAIL.EXE from the //QWK menu. If anyone
  wants this, then can add their own //QWK menu now that we have a
  menu editor since 4.3. This removed USE_WWIVMAIL and USE_INTERNAL_QWK
  from wwiv.ini.
* removed SLASH_SZ from wwiv.ini. It wasn't enabled by default anyway.
* Removed ReadMessages menu item. It wasn't classic WWIV
* 

What's New in 2015 (WWIV 5.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* networkb - BINKP transport for WWIV networking is now part of the WWIV builds.
* netutil - Network packet and config file utility now included
* network - shim to proxy between network0, networkp (PPP project) and networkb
  is now part of the product.
* A SSM will be sent to the sysop when a new user joins the bbs.
* WWIV moved from wwiv.sf.net to wwivbbs.org
* Source code moved from sourceforge.net to GitHub.
* Upgraded compilers from MSVC 2013 to 2015 Community.
* Upgraded .NET from 4.0 to 4.6
* Fixed hangs with guest user accounts when they drop connection
* Made all QWK filenames lowercase
* zip/unzip now bundled with WWIV on Windows
* linux builds now just include linux files, ditto for windows



What's New in 2014 (WWIV 5.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Many more things work.
* Init is open sourced
* Full self-bootstrapping support. No longer need 4.30 installed first.
* Added new parameter for chains/commands %H = Telnet Socket Handle
* Added wwiv.ini setting NO_NEWUSER_FEEDBACK. If set to Y no newuser messages
  will be sent at all.
* Added wwiv.ini setings to control temp/batch directories. This is no longer
  configured in init.  For TEMP_DIRECTORY/BATCH_DIRECTORY the %n is replaced
  by the node number of the instance. Also paths are relative to the bbs home
  directory (where config.dat lives).  NUM_INSTANCES defines how many intances
  you want to spawn.  Also node that directories are created on demand by the
  bbs on startup and config.ovr will be created by legacy tools when you run
  init.  
  Here are the default values:
    TEMP_DIRECTORY = temp%n
    BATCH_DIRECTORY = batch%n
    NUM_INSTANCES = 4
* INIT will create default archiver configuration for infozip's unzip/zip. If
  you want to try it just delete archiver.dat (back it up first) and rerun
  INIT to create the new defaults.
* Internal QWK support has been added and only works with ZIP archives for now.
  If you use this, please add the QWK.ANS and QWK.MSG files from the release
  archive into your GFILES directory.
* Added new wwiv.ini setting to enable/disable internal QWK and wwivmail from
  the //QWK menu.  These currently both default to 'Y' (the wwivmail one will
  shortly default to 'N', so if you use it please add this to your INI)
  Here are the ini keys and default values:
    USE_WWIVMAIL = Y
    USE_INTERNAL_QWK = Y
* New files will optionally be displayed at login (right after "login" file):
  sl### : where ### is the current user SL.
  dsl### : where ### is the current user DSL.
  arX : Where X is one of the AR for the user.
  darX : Where X is one of the DAR for the user.
* Added support for QBBS style external editors. Just set the editor type to
  QuickBBS instead of WWIV.
* SPAWNOPT[FSED] is now unused and no longer supported.  Spawn options are now
  set on a per-editor bases in INIT (similiar to how chains work).
* Fix now defaults to only fixing critical files.  To enable other "fixes" 
  (which I recommend using at your own risk after you backed up DATA/" use
  the command line flags to enable each of these.  See fix -? for help.
* EXEC_WAITFORIDLETIME and EXEC_USECWAITFORIDLE are no longer used, 
  EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME  should be used to set how long to wait for exec'ed
  processes to become runnable. It defaults to 500ms.

What's New in 5.0 Beta-2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Archver commands now work.
* F1 User Editor Improvements
* PuTTY now works with auto-detect line mode
* WFC now clears the screen in places it forgot to.
* Fixed Pending Network display glitches
* Changed Message Scan Prompt to 1 line from 2.
* Added Litebar calls in Your Info and Voting Booth for 
  a more common look and feel.

What's New in 5.0 Beta-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* File compatable with 4.30/4.31
* 32-bit Win32 version.
* Compiles and Runs on Linux.
* Included GUI Telnet Server.
* Internal ZModem
* DOOR32.SYS support.
* Uses the SyncFoss code from Synchronet (thanks to Rob Swindell for helping
  get this to work)  "Emulate Win32 FOSSIL" enables this.
* Added commandline option -k (pacK message areas) to wwiv50.  This 
  will pack all message areas unless you specify the number of the
  areas to pack on the commandline. i.e. "wwiv50 -k 1 5 10" would
  pack areas 1, 5 and 10. (Build46)
* If you add "NEW_SCAN_AT_LOGIN=Y" to WWIV.INI, then when a user logs 
  in they will be asked to scan all message areas for new messages. (Build46)
* The display while packing message bases is now a bit nicer looking.
* Changed filename global.txt to global-<node number>.txt (Build43)
* Added control-U for who's online hotkey. (Build40)
* Fixed laston edge case where the header didn't match the data when
  EXTENDED_USERINFO = N but SHOW_CITY_ST = Y. (Build40)
* FOSSIL can now be specified in WWIV.INI as a valid flag for spawn 
  options (Build37)
* Added 2 new pipe codes:
  * |#<wwiv color code 0-9> as an alternative to the "heart" codes
  * |@<macro character> as an alternative to ^O^O<macro char>
  * Existing pipe codes are: |B<background char>, and |<2 digit code>
    for foreground colors. (Build36) 
* Added parameter "%E" to stuff_in which can be used in doors as the path 
  to the DOOR32.SYS file (You can put this in chainedit or init) (Build35)
* Detects WinXP (Build34)
* '/A', '/H', '/?' Added to internal message editor (Build33)
* New WWIV.INI Parameters
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  EXEC_LOGSYNCFOSS     = [ 1 | 0 ] - If non-zero then wwivsync.log will 
                         be generated.  The default setting is 1 and this
                         is currently ignored.
  EXEC_USECWAITFORIDLE = [ 1 | 0 ] - Under WindowsNT/2K/XP when launching
                         the child process WWIV uses WaitForInputIdle to wait
                         for the child process to process all normal input 
                         before starting the Fossil handling code.  Setting
                         this to 0 will disable that (acting like Win9x where
                         we just wait for a bit (See EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME).  The
                         default value of this is 1.
  EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME   = (time to wait in milliseconds, this parameter is
                         only used on Win9X unless EXEC_USEWAITFORIDLE is
                         set to 0. The default value is 500 (1/2 second)
  EXEC_WAITFORIDLETIME = (time to wait in milliseconds, only used on 
                         Windows NT/2K/XP unless EXEC_USEWAITFORIDLE=0).  The
                         default value for this is 2000 (2 seconds)
