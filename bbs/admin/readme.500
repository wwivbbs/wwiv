                *** Attention XP and Windows 10 Users ***

    You need to download the Visual Studio 2013 redistributable files from:
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
    and install this package before using WWIV (or any other software
    compiled with Visual Studio 2013).


WWIV 5.0 Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you already have WWIV 5.0 installed, just copy the EXE and DLL files over
your existing 4.30 installation. Please backup your previous binaries and
configuration files.

The command line parameters have changed quite a bit, I suggest running
"WWIV50 -? | MORE" to see the list of changes.  Currently WWIV50 is command
line compatable with EleBBS (for all of the major command line arguments)

So far, WWIV 5.0 is still fully compatable with your existing WWIV 4.30
installation (Just drop it in and go).

Run WWIV5TelnetServer.exe and then select the menu Edit > Preferences and setup
the information for your configuration (paths, and the starting and ending
node numbers to use for inbound telnet). Then choose File > Start Server.
Now the WWIV5TelnetServer (WTS) is listening on a socket and ready to spawn 
instances of WWIV.  You do not need to keep multiple copies of WWIV running
at all times, as the WTS will spawn them as required.

*** Be sure to read WHATSNEW.TXT for a list of all the new major features and
other changes that have happened since 4.30. ***

NOTE: Serial I/O Support has been removed. Use one of the serial -> telnet
bridges for "Dial Up" support.

DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    WWIV is compiled with the following compilers:
        MS Visual C++ 2013.
        GCC 4.8 on Linux

    I recommend using MSVC 2013. (There is a the "express" edition
    available for free.
