     1Welcome0!  You have been approved for a full-access Sysop
account on this BBS.  One word of caution: be careful when answering
the following questions.  If you make any errors, you will not able
to call back and use ASV again until I reset your account status.

     Unfortunately, this BBS only offers auto-sysop-validation for
Sysops that I have personally invited to call the board.  Please
continue your log on as a newuser, leave feedback, and I will
review your application normally.  If you are indeed a Sysop, then
I will almost certainly validate you.

     You have had plenty of chances to enter your phone number.
If you don't want your account deleted, leave feedback.  Include
the results of your latest IQ test.  You have 10 minutes to
explain your actions.

     You have been successfully validated as a 1WWIVnet0 or 1ICEnet0
Sysop who runs a Network Server.  On behalf of the usually silent
Sysops on both nets, I'd like to thank you for your service.  Keep
up the great work!

     You now have 45 minutes per day and access to all of the WWIV
Support Subs available here.  You will start with expert menus (or
lack thereof), and your mail is currently set to be forwarded to
you at your server.

     Thank you for calling!  If you think this BBS can support
WWIV better, please let me know how, and I will try to implement
your suggestions.

     You have been successfully validated as a registered network
Sysop.  Thank you for supporting WWIV; it is Sysops like you who
make WWIV Source Code free.

     As you can see, this BBS is setup to automatically send you
email to user #1 on your BBS.  You should respond to this mail, as
if you do not I will assume that you are some hacker tarnishing
the real Sysop's good name.  If for some reason you don't get
mail, send some to me.

     You now have 45 minutes per day and access to all of the WWIV
Support Subs available here.  You will start with expert menus (or
lack thereof), and your mail is currently set to be forwarded to
you at your own BBS.  In addition, your WWIV Registration # has
been copied over to the D:efaults.

     If you have a high speed modem you have also been given 1 mb
of download credit.  Use it wisely, since after that first free
meg you will be subject to the ratio here.

     If you are calling at 2400 bps, you have been given 100k of
download credit.  You have also been given transfer section
access, a privilege that is withheld from all other 2400 bps
newusers.  Please don't abuse it!

     Thank you for calling!  If you think this BBS can support
WWIV better, please let me know how, and I will try to implement
your suggestions.

     You have been successfully validated as a network Sysop.
However, I could not ascertain whether you have registered WWIV.
While registered and unregistered WWIV Sysops receive the same
access here, if you haven't registered yet then I encourage you
to do so as soon as possible.

     Unfortunately, this BBS only offers auto-sysop-validation for Sysops
that I have personally invited to call the board.  If you would
like to log on here with ASV, please send email to the Sysop asking for
the password.  Or, alternatively, continue your log on as a newuser, leave
feedback, and I will review your application normally.  If you are indeed
a Sysop, then I will almost certainly validate you.
