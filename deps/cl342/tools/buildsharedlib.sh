# Build the shared library.  The options need to be tuned for some systems
# since there's no standard for shared libraries, and different versions of
# gcc also changed the way this was handled:
#
# AIX:			AIX requires some weird voodoo which is unlike any other
#				system's way of doing it (probably done by the MVS team,
#				see "AIX Linking and Loading Mechanisms" for a starter).
#				In addition to this, the shared lib (during development)
#				must be given permissions 750 to avoid loading it
#				permanently into the shared memory segment (only root can
#				remove it).  The production shared library must have a
#				555 (or whatever) permission.  Finally, the library has to
#				have a ".a" suffix (even though it's a shared lib), so we
#				tack this on after the $LIBNAME.
#
#				The various AIX options are: '-bnoentry' = don't look for a
#				main(), '-bE' = export the symbols in cryptlib.exp,
#				'-bM:SRE' = make it a shared library.
#				$(LD) -ldl -bE:cryptlib.exp -bM:SRE -bnoentry
# BeOS:			$(LD) -nostart
# Cygwin:		$(LD) -L/usr/local/lib -lcygipc
# HPUX:			Link with gcc (to the GNU libs) if compiled with gcc,
#				otherwise link with the standard compiler into the system
#				libs.  If you're mixing GNU and system libs (e.g. cryptlib
#				built with gcc and the calling app built with the HP cc),
#				you may want to use '-static-libgcc' to avoid having to ship
#				a copy of glibc just for cryptlib.
#				Note that on some versions of PHUX stripping the shared lib.
#				may prevent it from being linked, you may need to remove
#				this command in that case.
#				$(LD) -shared -Wl,-soname,lib$(PROJ).so.$(MAJ)
# Solaris:		$(LD) -G -ldl -o lib$(PROJ).so.$(MAJ)
#
# An additional possibility under the *BSDs and Linux is:
#
# *BSDs:		$(LD) -Bshareable -o lib$(PROJ).so.$(MAJ)
# Linux:		$(LD) -Bshareable -ldl -o lib$(PROJ).so.$(MAJ)

# Build the shared lib.  The use of x86 asm code causes some issues with
# relocation, to avoid this we use the -Bsymbolic option with the linker,
# which (explicitly) tells the linker to perform symbol lookup in the local
# library first and (implicitly) gets rid of spurious relocations because
# instead of having to perform intra-library references via the global
# offset table using a call to a jump table based at %ebx, the linker
# resolves the reference and uses a direct call as expected.  A nice
# side-effect of this rewiring of indirect to direct calls is that it makes
# it much harder to mess with library internals by getting your own symbols
# referenced before the library-internal ones (for example by using
# LD_PRELOAD), thus redirecting control flow to arbitrary external code.
