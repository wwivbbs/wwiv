#
# Comments:
#
#	-lbsd = flock() support via BSD compatibility layer for Aches.
#	-lc_r = libc extended with re-entrant functions needed for threading.
#			This is required by FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE but not FreeBSD 5.1-
#			CURRENT, which has the standard libc re-entrant.  Because there's
#			no easy way to tell what we're running under (they both have the
#			same version numbers) we'd have to use it for both, however by
#			using -pthread during the compile we can tell the compiler to
#			sort the mess out for us - it'll link against libc_r or libc as
#			appropriate.
#	-ldl = dload() support for dynamically loaded PKCS #11 drivers.  Some
#			Debian releases require that the use of this library be
#			explicitly specified, although there's no discernable pattern
#			for when this might be required (or even any easy way to detect
#			Debian), so we unconditionally include it under Linux if libdl
#			exists.  Note that on some Linux systems it's hidden in
#			/usr/lib32 or /usr/lib64 so we check for multiple locations,
#			and then Ubuntu makes it even worse by hiding it in even more
#			places like /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.
#			If this continues then it may be easier to just assume that
#			Linux, or at least Ubuntu, always has libdl present.  As a
#			somewhat safer alternative we first try ldconfig, and only then
#			fall back to hardcoded locations.
#	-lgcc = Extra gcc support lib needed for BSDI, which ships with gcc but
#			not the proper libs for it.
#	-lkstat = kstat functions for Solaris randomness gathering.
#	-lsocket = Resolver functions.
#	-lnsl = Socket support for Slowaris, which doesn't have it in libc.
#   -lposix4 = Solaris 2.5 and 2.6 library for sched_yield.
#	-lresolv = Resolver functions.
# 	-lrt = Solaris 2.7 and above realtime library for sched_yield().
#	-lssp = gcc additional library needed in some cases when
#			-f-stack-protector is used.
#	-lthread/lpthread/lpthreads = pthreads support.  Note that this generally
#			has to be linked as late as possible (and in particular after the
#			implied -lc) because libpthread overrides non-thread-safe and stub
#			functions in libraries linked earlier on with thread-safe
#			alternatives.
#	-lw = Widechar support.
