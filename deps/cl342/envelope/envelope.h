/* Types of actions that can be performed on a piece of envelope data.  The 
   two key exchange actions are handled identically, but are given different 
   tags because we place PKC-based key exchange actions (which may be 
   handled automatically on de-enveloping) before conventional key exchange 
   actions (which usually require manual intervention for passphrases).  For 
   this reason the actions are given in their sort order (i.e. 
   ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE_PKC precedes ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE in the action list).
   The same occurs for the crypto actions ACTION_xxx, ACTION_CRYPT, and
   ACTION_MAC, which when used for authenticated encryption are applied in
   that order */

/* An 'action list' that defines what we need to do to the content when
   enveloping data.  There are three action lists, one for actions to perform
   before enveloping data, one to perform during enveloping (which is 
   actually just a single action rather than a list), and one to perform 
   after enveloping.  ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE and ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE_PKC are found 
   in the pre-enveloping list, ACTION_SIGN in the post-enveloping list, and 
   everything else in the during-enveloping list.

   Some actions are many-to-one, in which a number of controlling actions in
   one list may act on a single subject action in another list (for example a
   number of signature actions may sign the output from a single hash
   action).  This is handled by having the controlling actions maintain
   pointers to the subject action, for example a number of key export actions
   would point to one encryption action, with the export actions exporting
   the session key for the encryption action.

   The flags are:

	ACTION_ADDEDAUTOMATICALLY: Whether a subject action was added 
			automatically and invisibly to the caller as a result of adding 
			a controlling action, for example a hash action created when a 
			signing action is added.  This is to ensure that we don't return 
			an error the first time the caller adds an action which is 
			identical to an automatically added action.

	ACTION_HASHCOMPLETE: Whether the hashing for a hash action has already
			been completed and we don't need to do it ourselves.  If we're 
			using a detached signature then the hash value will be supplied
			externally and there's no need to complete the hashing.
   
	ACTION_NEEDSCONTROLLER: Whether this is a subject action that still 
			requires a controlling action.  This allows us to identify 
			unused subject actions more easily than by scanning all 
			controller->subject relationships */

/* The current state of the processing of CMS headers that contain non-data

   a somewhat complex FSM because the enveloping routines give the user the
   ability to push in arbitrary amounts of data corresponding to various
   enveloping structures and simultaneously pop out data/information based 
   on decoding them.  A typical complex enveloped type might contain a 
   number of headers, a session key encrypted with 18 different public keys, 
   five varieties of signature type, and God knows what else, of which the 
   caller might feed us 500 bytes - a small fraction of the total data - and 
   then ask for information on what they've just fed us.  We have to 
   remember how far we got (halfway through an RSA-encrypted DES key fifteen 
   levels of nesting down in an ASN.1 structure), process everything that we 
   can, and then get back to them on what we found.  Then they feed us 
   another few hundred bytes and the whole thing starts anew.

   The state machine works by processing one complete object or part of an
   object at a time and then moving on to the next state that corresponds to
   handling another part of the object or another object.  If there isn't
   enough data present to process a part or subpart, we return an underflow
   error and try again when more data is added */

	ENVDATA_HASINDEFTRAILER: The (signed) envelope trailer has an indefinite
			length due to the use of signature algorithms that produce 
			variable-length output that can't be determined in advance.

	ENVDATA_HASHACTIONSACTIVE: The (signed) envelope is currently hashing
			payload data.  This differs from AUTHENCACTIONSACTIVE in that
			it hashes plaintext, not ciphertext.

	ENVDATA_NOLENGTHINFO: The payload uses neither a definite- nor 
			indefinite-length encoding but continues until the caller tells
			us it's finished.  This is used to handle PGP 2.x compressed
			data, which just continues until EOF with no length information
			provided.

	ENVDATA_NOSEGMENT: The payload data shouldn't be segmented because a
			definite-length encoding is being used.

	ENVDATA_NOFIRSTSEGMENT: The payload data is segmented but the first 
			segment doesn't have an explicit length, being defined as 
			"whatever's left after the data at the start has been 
			processed".  This is used to handle PGP's indefinite-length
			encoding, which unlike ASN.1's 
			
				[indef.marker][segment][segment]...[EOC]

			is encoded as:

				[length+cont,segment'][length+cont,segment]...[length,segment]

			so the initial length has already been read when the packet
			header was read.  We can't undo the read of the start of the 
			first packet and treat it as a standard segement because the 
			encoding for the first segment (denoted by segment' in the 
			diagram above) and the remaining segments is different so an 
			attempt to treat them identically will lead to a decoding error.

	ENVDATA_SEGMENTCOMPLETE: An indefinite-length segment has been completed
			an another one must be begun before more payload data can be
			emitted.

	ENVDATA_ENDOFCONTENTS: The EOC octets on indefinite payload data have 
			been reached.

	ENVDATA_NEEDSPADDING: Before (encrypted) enveloping can been completed 
			the payload data needs PKCS #5 padding added to it.

	ENVDATA_HASATTACHEDOOB: The envelope has out-of-band additional data
			attached to the payload data.  This is used by OpenPGP to tack
			an MDC packet onto the end of encrypted data.
