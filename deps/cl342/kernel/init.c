/* Correct initialisation of the kernel is handled by having the object
   management functions check the state of the initialisation flag before
   they do anything and returning CRYPT_ERROR_NOTINITED if cryptlib hasn't
   been initialised.  Since everything in cryptlib depends on the creation
   of objects, any attempt to use cryptlib without it being properly
   initialised are caught.

   Reading the initialisation flag presents something of a chicken-and-egg
   problem since the read should be protected by the intialisation mutex,
   but we can't try and grab it unless the mutex has been initialised.  If
   we just read the flag directly and rely on the object map mutex to
   protect access we run into a potential race condition on shutdown:

	thread1								thread2

	inited = T							read inited = T
	inited = F, destroy objects
										lock objects, die

   The usual way to avoid this is to perform an interlocked mutex lock, but
   this isn't possible here since the initialisation mutex may not be
   initialised.

   If possible we use dynamic initialisation of the kernel to resolve this,
   taking advantage of stubs that the compiler inserts into the code to
   perform initialisation functions when cryptlib is loaded.  If the
   compiler doesn't support this, we have to use static initialisation.
   This has a slight potential race condition if two threads call the init
   function at the same time, but in practice the only thing that can happen
   is that the initialisation mutex gets initialised twice, leading to a
   small resource leak when cryptlib shuts down */
