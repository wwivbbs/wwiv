Menu commands are called by there name and a number of options parameters.

The following forms are valid syntax

command without parameters  : menucmd
command with one parameter  : menucmd "xyz"
command with two parameters : menucmd 123, "abc def"
command with two parameters : menucmd(456,"abc")



You can stack multiple menu commands by seperating them with the ~ key.

The following code ...

menucmd1 ~ menucmd2("abc") ~ menucmd3 "abc", 123

... will execute menucmd1 (without any parameters), menucmd2 with abc as a
parameter, and finally, menucmd3 with "abc" and 123 as parameters.


Most menu commands run without any parameters at all, and most are taken
straight from the main and xfer menus.  Additional commands are added to
manage the menu system as well as a few commands which will help you to
emulate other BBSes.


MENU <menu>

  Loads up and starts running a new menu set, where <menu> equals the name of
  the menu to load.


ReturnFromMenu

  Unloads the current menu and goes back to the menu that loaded the current
  one.  If you try to return from the very first menu, it will just be reloaded


EditMenuSet

  This command will take you into the menu editor.  Keep carefull to keep this
  command tied down as anyone with access to the menu editor will have 100%
  access to your system.



DLFreeFile <dirfname> <filename>

  This will download a file, but not check ratios or charge a download charge.
  You must specify the dirfilename, which is the name of the data file in
  the transfer editor.  filename is the name of the file being downloaded.



DLFile

  This will download a file, with a check for ratios and will update the
  kb downloaded and number of files downloaded.
  You must specify the dirfilename, which is the name of the data file in
  the transfer editor.  filename is the name of the file being downloaded.


RunDoor <doorname>

  Runs a door (chain) with doorname matching, exactly, the description you have
  given the door in //CHEDIT


RunDoorFree <doorname>

  Runs a door (chain) with doorname matching, exactly, the description you have
  given the door in //CHEDIT, but this function bypasses the check to see if
  the user is allowed to run the door.

RunDoorNumber <door#>

  Like RunDoor, but you must specify the #1 in //CHEDIT instead of the
  description.

RunDoorNumberFree

  Like RunDoorFree, but you must specify the #1 in //CHEDIT instead of the
  description.

PrintFile <filename>

  Prints a file, first checking to see if you specified an absolute path,
  then the language dir, then the gfilesdir.  It will use the usual checks to
  determin .ANS, or .MSG if not specified.

PrintFileNA <filename>

  Just like PrintFile, but the user can not abort it with the space bar.



SetSubNumber <key>

  Equivalent to typing in a number at the main menu, it sets the current sub
  number.

  number.

  This will prompt the user to enter a sub to change to.  However, it does not
