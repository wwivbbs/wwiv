;The NUM_ACTIONS setting tells the chatroom how many actions to read from
;WWIV.INI.  This can be smaller than the actual number of actions in the
;data file, but if it is larger problems could occur.  Set this equal to 0
;to disable actions.
NUM_ACTIONS = 39

;Following this are the action declarations.  The format is simple.  The
;first line of each action is the number of the action, followed by an A.
;Make this equal to 0 if no recipient is required for the action, or 1 if
;a recipient is required.  The second line contains the name of the action
;(no longer than 12 characters!), the third the text to be printed to the
;person doing the action, the fourth the text to be printed to the recipient
;of the action, and the fifth the text printed to everyone else.  If you're
;short on RAM, keep this list brief.  The chatroom is able to support up to
;100 actions, but it only uses RAM for as many actions as you provide it.
;A full 100 actions would require about 25k of RAM.

;These actions MUST be in alphabetical order or the chatroom will not find them!
