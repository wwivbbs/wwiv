;                               SPAWN OPTIONS
;=============================================================================
;
; The various spawn options that may be used are:
;
; NOHUP        Doesn't check for hangup
; COMIO        Intercept DOS interrupts (Win32 Only)
; FOSSIL       Emulate the FOSSIL for DOS applications (Win32 Only)
; NETPROG      Tries to run program in network data dir first.
;
; Options can be combined like so:
;
; SPAWNOPTS[LOGON]=FOSSIL,NOHANGUP
;
; Valid locations that can have spawn options specified are:
;
; NEWUSER, BEGINDAY, LOGON, LOGOFF ULCHK, PROT_SINGLE,
; PROT_BATCH, ARCH_E, ARCH_V, ARCH_A, ARCH_D, ARCH_K, ARCH_T
;
; Values listed for lines commented out are the default settings.  Under
; normal conditions, you should not have to edit these settings.  If you
; have problems getting the stock spawn options to work properly with
; your supporting program, try adding COMIO.  These are
; the most commonly used settings.

;                               COLOR OPTIONS
;=============================================================================
;
; NOTE:  Although the BBS is capable of using over 90 color combinations,
; only the first ten may be set here.  The remaining colors are set from
; inside the BBS.
;
; Colors are selected numerically. To determine the value for a color, use the
; following chart:
;
;    0 = Black             8  = Dark Gray
;    1 = Blue              9  = Light Blue
;    2 = Green             10 = Light Green
;    3 = Cyan              11 = Light Cyan
;    4 = Red               12 = Light Red
;    5 = Magenta           13 = Light Magenta
;    6 = Brown             14 = Yellow
;    7 = Light Gray        15 = White
;
; Now, to calculate a color, you take the value for the background color and
; multiply by 16, then add it to the foreground color you wish. This will
; provide the value you should use for that color combination. Note that
: color values greater than 127 will result in blinking. In other words,
; you should probably restrict background colors to colors 0-7 above.
;
; An example: if you want to find the value for, say, bright yellow on 
: magenta, it would be (5*16) + 14. This equates to (magenta * 16) + white.
