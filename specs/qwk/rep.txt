                 Format of the BBSID.REP file for replies


      The record format of the BBSID.MSG file in the BBSID.REP file
      is exactly identical to the MESSAGES.DAT format except the
      packet header which now is filled with blanks except that it
      contains the BBSID as the first few characters.


      On the Message Headers there is also one change.  The ascii
      field which normally contains the message number is now filled
      (in ascii) with the conference number of the message.  Note
      that some readers which place the conference number here,
      neglect to fill in the normal Message Header conference
      number field.
