Synchronet QWK Network Extenstions 03/23/95
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This document is intended for developers of QWK off-line readers or mail doors
for non-Synchronet BBS packages.

Synchronet multinode BBS software (by Digital Dynamics) has never had a QWK
door written for it, because it has had extensive internal QWK off-line reader
and network support since version 1 (1992). Since QWK networking is such an
integrated component of Synchronet, it is extremely easy to setup and maintain
in comparison to other network technologies (Fido, PostLink, Internet, etc.)
which are also internally supported, but not as easy to setup for novice
sysops.

Through our (Digital Dynamics) own extensions to the QWKnet pseudo-standard,
we have filled many of the gaps that left QWK behind when it came to more
advanced network needs (most notably, routed NetMail).

Not all of the information in this document will be relevant to your
development, but we would much rather give too much information, than not
enough. If other BBS program/mail-door authors choose not to implement this
standard, it WON'T be because we didn't supply enough information!

Our QWKnet extensions are an evolving entity and we're definitely open
to suggestions for future enhancements/compatibilty issues. See the end of
this document for ways to contact Digital Dynamics. We encourage other
developers to contact us directly for questions or notification of
compatibility or intended compatibility between their product and ours.

Basics
------
Synchronet has an entirely separate message area specifically designed for
local E-mail and NetMail (as opposed to public message areas or "echoes").
This "e-mail" message area is always conference number 0 in a QWK or REP
packet. All non-zero conferences are sub-boards (AKA "Echoes", "SIGs",
"Forums", etc).

QWK IDs (AKA BBSID) consist of between two and eight valid DOS characters and
the first character must be alphabetic. QWK IDs must not contain the '@'
character. It is extremely beneficial if all QWK IDs are unique in a given
network of systems. QWK IDs that do not match this format may work for basic
QWKnet functions, but many features may not work. QWK IDs are always considered
case insensitive. The strings "SYSOP" and "NETMAIL" must are not valid QWK IDs.

A QWKnet node on a Synchronet BBS must be created specifically for QWK
networking. This is done by using the node's QWK ID as the user name on the
BBS and the sysop must give the account the 'Q' restriction. This restriction
allows the uploaded REP packets to come from any user name (AKA Net Status)
and automatically eliminates non-QWK networked sub-boards from the QWK packets.
The 'Q' restriction causes the QWK menu to immediately come up at logon
(rather than the normal "user" logon procedure), taglines are added to
locally created messages being exported to REP packets, as well as other
behavior differences from normal "user" accounts. Synchronet creates a
NETFLAGS.DAT file for 'Q' restricted accounts that haven't disabled CONTROL
files in the QWK packets, though Synchronet itself does not ever use the
NETFLAGS.DAT - it's created for compatibility with non-Synchronet QWKnet nodes.

Conference Numbers
------------------
When calling a Synchronet BBS for QWK packets, conference numbers will start
at 0 (for E-mail) and then jump to 1001 or 2001 or a similar number.
The thousands place represents the message Group number and the hundreds place
represents the Sub-board number within that group. Conference numbers are
not necessarily consequetive, though they are (at this time) always sequential.
The CONTROL.DAT file will contain a list of all the conferences (and numbers)
the current account has access to. Here is an example CONTROL.DAT:

When a Synchronet system calls a QWKnet hub, it can use any conference number
scheme the hub system is using (max conference number 65535), but NetMail is
always assumed to be sent and received from conference number 0.

REP Packet Control Messages
---------------------------
When calling a Synchronet BBS, the following control messages are supported
when included in an uploaded REP packet:

Subj: DROP [conf#]
Note: Drop current conference (or specified conference #) from future packets

Subj: ADD [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Add current conference to future packets and optionally set message ptr

Subj: ADD [YOURS] [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Add current conference to future packets and optionally set message ptr
      If "YOURS" is specified, only mail addressed to you will be packed for
      this conference. Not applicable for QWKnet node accounts.

Subj: YOURS [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Same as "ADD YOURS"

Subj: RESET [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Set message pointer for current conference, - indicates offset from last

Subj: RESETALL [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Set message pointers for all conferences

Subj: FREQ <filename>
Note: File Request from file transfer database (not attachments)

Subj: FILES [ON | OFF | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Include files list in packet and/or specify new-scan date

Subj: ATTACH [ON | OFF]
Note: Include file attachments in packet automatically (e-mail only)

Subj: MAIL [ALL | ON | OFF]
Note: Include private mail-box (ALL includes previously read mail)

Subj: DELMAIL [ON | OFF]
Note: Automatically delete mail-box after successful packet download

Subj: CTRL-A [KEEP | EXPAND | STRIP]
Note: Ctrl-A color/attribute codes - leave-in, expand to ANSI, or remove

Subj: NDX [ON | OFF]
Note: Include index (.NDX) files (not necessary for Synchronet QWKnet)

Subj: CONTROL [ON | OFF]
Note: Include control files (DOOR.ID, CONTROL.DAT, NETFLAGS.DAT, etc)

Subj: VIA [ON | OFF]
Note: Include messge path (@VIA) line in messages

Subj: TZ [ON | OFF]
Note: Include time zone (@TZ) line in messages

Transferring Files Between Nodes and Hubs
-----------------------------------------
Any non-QWK related files included in a QWKnet REP packet uploaded to a
Synchronet BBS (or QWK packets received from a QWKnet hub) will be
automatically moved into the DATA\QNET\<QWKID.IN> directory (where QWKID is the
QWK ID of the node or hub that sent the file) and the sysop will be notified of
the received file.

If a Synchronet sysop wishes to send a QWKnet node or hub a file, he need only
create the directory DATA\QNET\<QWKID.OUT> (where QWKID is the QWK ID of the
destination node) and copy the file(s) into this directory. The next time this
node calls and downloads a REP packet (or a QWK is packed for the hub), this
file will be archived in the packet automatically and then deleted from the
.OUT directory. This is NOT the same as FREQing (File Requesting) a file. It is
just a simple means of transferring files between QWKnet nodes and hubs.

NetMail
-------
When downloading a QWKnet packet from a Synchronet BBS, any e-mail (conf #0)
waiting for the QWKnet node account will be automatically included in the
packet. If the TO: name is the node's QWK ID or the word "SYSOP" (not case
sensitive), the NetMail should be assumed to be intended for the Sysop.
Otherwise if the TO: name is not "NETMAIL" (not case sensitive), then it is a
single hop NetMail message intended for a user on the node's system going by
the TO: name. The same holds true for REP packets sent to hubs containing
messages in conf #0.

Routed NetMail
--------------
Messages sent to "NETMAIL" (not case sensitve) in conference number 0 are
intended for another system that the current system unpacking the packet
must forward the message to. The destination user name and address will be
on the VERY first line of the message text in the following format:
"name@addr"
Where "name" is the full user name (25 chars max) and "addr" is EITHER the
destination node's QWK ID or the complete routing address. Complete routing
addresses are stored as: "NEXTID/.../DESTID", where NEXTID is the QWK ID of
next system in the link and DESTID is the inteded destination's QWK ID. The
"..." portion of the above routed address designates a variable number of
QWK IDs to pass through before reaching the DESTID.

Synchronet, automatically expands QWK ID's to complete routing addresses
whenever possible (when the path is known), so expect to find the complete
routing address more often than just the destination QWK ID.

When a system discovers a routed NetMail message in a QWK or REP packet it
needs to determine if the next hop is the destination node, and if so, change
the TO: field to the destination user name and eliminate the "user@addr"
line from the message.

If the next hop is not the destination node, it needs to leave the TO: field
as "NETMAIL" and remove itself and the next hop from the "addr" portion of
the "user@addr" line before creating the QWK or REP packet for the next hop.
After exporting the NetMail message sucessfully to QWK or REP, it should be
deleted.

EchoMail
--------
So, you're probably asking yourself, how does Synchronet know how to expand
a QWK ID into a complete routing address? Well, the @VIA: line is the key.
Every mail message (EchoMail and NetMail) that has passed through at least one
system to reach the current system will contain a special first line in the
body text:
"@VIA: QWKID/.../ORGID"
Where QWKID is the ID of the system that sent the message to the system that
created the QWK or REP packet being unpacked and ORGID is the originating
system's QWK ID.

Mail that originates on a node or hub will not contain an @VIA: line when
exported to nodes or hub that are directly connected to it. Only when THOSE
systems then export the message again, is the @VIA: line added.

Synchronet parses the @VIA: line (if it exists) to automatically maintain
a dynamic "route map" (filename DATA\QNET\ROUTE.DAT). Each line contains
information about a QWKnet system that is not directly connected. The format
(though not necessarily relevant to other BBS packages) is:
"MM/DD/YY DESTID:QWKID/QWKID/QWKID/..."
Where MM/DD/YY is the date the entry was last updated in the route file, DESTID
is the QWK ID of the system which we are defining the routing, and QWKID/QWKID
etc. are the QWK IDs of the systems necessary to reach DESTID.

Synchronet updates entries for existing DESTID, so if the routing changes,
the route file changes automatically. Old entries (indicating no mail traffic
from DESTID in X number of days) are automatically deleted. Synchronet uses 90
days as maximum age to keep old route entries.

Synchronet comes with a utility (QWKNODES.EXE) that can be used to manually
scan the existing message bases and create a ROUTE.DAT file (mentioned above),
a USERS.DAT file (for automatically looking up user names on other systems),
and a NODES.DAT file (not currently used by Synchronet, mainly for human
consumption - finding a QWKnode near you!). The format of the USERS.DAT file
is each line:
"username                   DESTID    MM/DD/YY  (QWKID/.../DESTID)"
Where username is the user's full name, DESTID is the QWK ID of the system
the user is on (or last posted from), MM/DD/YY is the date the message was
imported, and QWKID/.../ is the path to the DESTID (if not direct connection).
The only parts Synchronet uses at this time are username and DESTID (ROUTE.DAT
is used to expand to complete routing address if necessary).

When importing mail with an @VIA: line, Synchronet also checks to make
sure that the current system's QWK ID is not present in the list of QWK IDs.
If it is present, then the message is assumed to be an erroneous dupe loop and
is ignored (not imported). This is called "circular path detection" and is
caused by systems that accidentally hub off of more than one system in the
same QWK network causing a message "loop".

@VIA: lines can be disabled on a Synchronet hub by sending a message to "SBBS"
with a title of "VIA OFF".

Synchronet automatically disables @VIA: lines for hubs when "Ctrl-A Codes" are
not set to "Leave-in" (this is done by the Synchronet sysop in SCFG), assuming
this indicates the hub BBS is not a Synchronet system. So, if you're receiving
@VIA: codes from a Synchronet BBS that is a node (not a hub) off of your
system, expect to receive Synchronet Ctrl-A codes too! :) Synchronet Ctrl-A
codes are ANSI equivalents (using a more simple escape sequence) defined as:

(All attribute codes are be preceeded by a Ctrl-A character - ASCII 1)

	Foreground  Background
Black	    K		0
Red	    R		1
Green	    G		2
Yellow	    Y		3
Blue	    B		4
Magenta     M		 5
Cyan	    C		6
White	    W		7

High	    H	High Intensity
Blink	    I	Blinking
Normal      N   No Special Attributes
Pause       P   Insert a Pause Prompt into message
CLS         L   Insert a Form Feed into message


Time Zone
---------
Another missing element of the QWK format is time zone information. Synchronet
offers time zone information in QWK messages by adding an @TZ: line before the
message body (below "name@addr" and "@VIA:" lines if they exist). The time
zone specified is of the originating system. The format is:
"@TZ: xxxx"
Where xxxx are four hex digits (16-bit signed value). The value of the hex
digits is defined in the SMB (Synchronet Message Base) specification, but for
your convenience, we have included it here:

	If the zone is in the range -720 to +720, it represents the
	number of minutes east or west of UT. Values in this range
	should only be used for time zones not otherwise represented
	here.

	If the zone is greater than 720 or less than -720, then the
	following bits have special meaning:

	(1<<12) 	// Non-US time zone	(east of UT)
	(1<<13) 	// Non-US time zone	(west of UT)
	(1<<14) 	// U.S. time zone
	(1<<15) 	// Daylight savings

	The lower 12 bits (0 through 11) contain the number of minutes
	east or west of UT (not accounting for daylight savings).

	If the time zone is one specified in the U.S. Uniform Time Act,
	the following values represent the zone:

	AST 0x40F0	// Atlantic		(-04:00)
	EST 0x412C	// Eastern		(-05:00)
	CST 0x4168	// Central		(-06:00)
	MST 0x41A4	// Mountain		(-07:00)
	PST 0x41E0	// Pacific		(-08:00)
	YST 0x421C	// Yukon		(-09:00)
	HST 0x4258	// Hawaii/Alaska	(-10:00)
	BST 0x4294	// Bering		(-11:00)

	With bit 15 set, the following values represent the same zone
	with the presence of daylight savings:

	ADT 0xC0F0	// Atlantic		(-03:00)
	EDT 0xC12C	// Eastern		(-04:00)
	CDT 0xC168	// Central		(-05:00)
	MDT 0xC1A4	// Mountain		(-06:00)
	PDT 0xC1E0	// Pacific		(-07:00)
	YDT 0xC21C	// Yukon		(-08:00)
	HDT 0xC258	// Hawaii/Alaska	(-09:00)
	BDT 0xC294	// Bering		(-10:00)

	The following non-standard time zone specifications may also be
	used:

	MID 0x2294	// Midway		(-11:00)
	VAN 0x21E0	// Vancouver		(-08:00)
	EDM 0x21A4	// Edmonton		(-07:00)
	WIN 0x2168	// Winnipeg		(-06:00)
	BOG 0x212C	// Bogota		(-05:00)
	CAR 0x20F0	// Caracas		(-04:00)
	RIO 0x20B4	// Rio de Janeiro	(-03:00)
	FER 0x2078	// Fernando de Noronha	(-02:00)

Examples
--------
Examples are usually helpful at understanding concepts, so we are going to
use a real-life Synchronet extended QWK network (DOVE-Net) to deomonstrate
how the above extensions work.

First, the network topology (abbreviated for this example):

	   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄVERTÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
	   ³		    ³	       ³			³

			       ³		³
			     BLAZING	   WILDHARE


The ROUTE.DAT on VERT (main hub) for the above (in case you were curious):

--------------------------------[ Cut Here ]-----------------------------------
03/22/95 CIRCLE7:PHOUSE
03/22/95 TLOC:NITEMOVE
03/22/95 FANTAIR:PHOUSE
03/20/95 TALONBBS:CENTURY
03/17/95 BLAZING:NITEMOVE/TLOC
03/19/95 KRYSTAL:PHOUSE
03/19/95 VSS_BBS:CENTURY
03/20/95 PHOENIX:CENTURY
03/20/95 WILDHARE:NITEMOVE/TLOC
--------------------------------[ Cut Here ]-----------------------------------

Mail originating on VERT would NOT contain an @VIA: line when sent to the
following systems: PHOUSE, DOMAIN, NITEMOVE, and CENTURY. Mail originating on
VERT would contain "@VIA: VERT" when sent to the systems: CIRCLE7, FANTAIR,
KRYSTAL, TLOC, TALONBBS, VSS_BBS, and PHOENIX. Mail originating on VERT would
contain "@VIA: NITEMOVE/VERT" went sent to the following systems: BLAZING and
WILDHARE.

Mail originating on BLAZING would contain the following @VIA: lines when sent
to the following systems:

TLOC:	   <none>
WILDHARE:  "@VIA: BLAZING"
NITEMOVE:  "@VIA: BLAZING"
VERT:	   "@VIA: TLOC/BLAZING"
DOMAIN:    "@VIA: NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
PHOUSE:    "@VIA: NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
CIRCLE7:   "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
FANTAIR:   "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
KRYSTAL:   "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
CENTURY:   "@VIA: NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
TALONBBS:  "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
VSS_BBS:   "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"
PHOENIX:   "@VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING"

Each of the above systems needs to have its own way of storing the QWK ID of
the system the message last came from, so it can build the entire return
address. Luckily, all of the above are Synchronet systems, which stores the
complete route address in the SMB format message header. Different BBS packages
will need different ways of storing the originating QWK ID or (preferrably)
the complete route address (built from the above VIA path with the last hop
QWK prepended to the address).

Using the above example, VERT would store the QWKnet address of mail
originating from WILDHARE as "NITEMOVE/TLOC/WILDHARE". Synchronet does not
actually store addresses in its local message bases using @VIA:. This is
only used for extended the QWK format (which doesn't have a storage area for
network addresses). The @VIA: portion of the message body is added and removed
automatically from each message imported from or exported to QWK format (if
applicable).

Using a Route Map
-----------------
If the BBS software or mail door uses a route map, (similar to the ROUTE.DAT
that Synchronet uses), it should be able to insert routing information on
the fly.

If for example, a user on VERT sent NetMail to a user on WILDHARE, Synchronet
would look in the ROUTE.DAT and find an entry for WILDHARE and automatically
expand the address from "user@WILDHARE" to "user@NITEMOVE/TLOC/WILDHARE".
If a user on VERT were to send NetMail to "user@WILDHARE/BIGBBS", Synchronet
would not even look for BIGBBS in the ROUTE.DAT (it only looks for the first
hop in the routing), so it would still route the message properly to WILDHARE
by changing the address to NITEMOVE/TLOC/WILDHARE/BIGBBS.

Each system that receives NetMail should compare the destination QWK ID to
all the QWKnet nodes it feeds and the hubs it calls. If a match is found, it
should ignore the routing information and send it directly (overriding the
specified routing). Example, a user on TALONBBS sends NetMail to
"user@CENTURY/VERT/PHOUSE/NITEMOVE" (an incorrect route, but valid as far as
CENTURY knows) - it is possible that PHOUSE now feeds NITEMOVE and CENTURY does
not yet know about it, so it leaves the route address intact and passes the
message on to VERT. VERT sees that it feeds NITEMOVE directly, so it sends the
mail directly (removing the routing information).

NetMail (again)
---------------
Using the above example network topology, if a user were to send NetMail
from BLAZING to a user on CIRCLE7:

REP sent from BLAZING to TLOC:
Conf #0 - To: NETMAIL
	  1stLine: username@NITEMOVE/VERT/PHOUSE/CIRCLE7

REP sent from TLOC to NITEMOVE:
Conf #0 - To: NETMAIL
	  1stLine: username@VERT/PHOUSE/CIRCLE7
	  2ndLine: @VIA: BLAZING

REP sent from NITEMOVE to VERT:
Conf #0 - To: NETMAIL
	  1stLine: username@PHOUSE/CIRCLE7
	  2ndLine: @VIA: TLOC/BLAZING

QWK sent from VERT to PHOUSE:
Conf #0 - To: NETMAIL
	  1stLine: username@CIRCLE7
	  2ndLine: @VIA: NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING

QWK sent from PHOUSE to CIRCLE7:
Conf #0 - To: username
	  1stLine: @VIA: VERT/NITEMOVE/TLOC/BLAZING
